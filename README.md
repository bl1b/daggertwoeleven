# daggertwoeleven
This project showcases various use-cases of dependency-injection using Dagger >= 2.11.

## Use-Cases
### Application extending DaggerApplication
1. `AndroidManifest.xml` refers to the `Application`-class
   ```xml
   <application
           android:name=".App"
   ``` 
2. `Application`-class extends from `DaggerApplication` 
   ```java
   public class App extends DaggerApplication 
   ```
3. `@dagger.Component` (inside `Application`-class or in a separate file)  **must** contain module `AndroidSupportInjectionModule.class`
    ```java
    @dagger.Component(modules = {AndroidSupportInjectionModule.class})
    interface Component extends AndroidInjector<App> {
        @dagger.Component.Builder
        abstract class Builder extends AndroidInjector.Builder<App> {}
    }
    ```
4. `Application`-class **must** `@Override` the method `applicationInjector()`
    ```java
    @Override
    protected AndroidInjector<? extends DaggerApplication> applicationInjector() {
        return DaggerApp_Component
                .builder()
                .create(this);
    }
    ```
    The class`DaggerApp_Component` will be generated automatically by the annotationProcessor.\
    If not, try building the project and try again.\
    If it's still not working there's something wrong.
